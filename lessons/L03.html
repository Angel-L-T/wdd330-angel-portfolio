        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object (JS Novice to Ninja)</h3>
        <p>What I understood is that when you are in a browser environment, instead of having a global object you get a window object. So, every variable and function we create inside of it will become a property and a method of the Window object. I learned also that there is Browser Object Model (Something similar to DOM), which has no standard model, but has some methods from which you can obtain information about the browser.</p>
        <p>I also learned that cookies are pieces of information saved locally on small files. These pieces of information can keep track util information for the user to remember in a website. They have an expiration date, and they can only be accessed by the same domain that created them.</p>

        <h3>MDN The Content Template Element</h3>
        <p>What I understood about the template element is that you can create this element in an html file with the purpose of cloning it to create more elements based on it. When created, it is not going to be rendered to the page, because it is meant to be a template as its name suggests.</p>
