        <h3>Getting Started with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</h3>
        <p>What I understand from the article and other resources, JWTs purpose is to verify a user and then if everything is alright the server will authorize the user access to different information or pages in the server. All the information required for this process is in the same JWT, coded using one from many different algorithms. A JWT has three parts, the header which contains the type of token and algorithm, the payload that contains the information about the user, and the signature which is a key generated by the server to identify the user and make sure that no changes were made in the JWT.</p>

        <p>Here's a video I watched to better understand the concepts:</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM">What Is JWT and Why Should You Use JWT</a></p>

        <h3>Develop, Debug, Learn?</h3>
        <p>This video was a little hard to follow for me, so I will just write a few things about it. The man giving the talk (Chris Heilman), talks about some problems that arouse while the web development world started growing. For example, how libraries and different tools were created, resulting in projects build around those tools that made developers dependent on the libraries to solve some problems for them. Tools that were created and soon enough disappeared. Trying to debug things that were in those same libraries and frameworks. And finally, lots of code included in those libraries that you probably won’t use but you have to download it anyway. </p>
        <p>He also speaks about how entering the world of development has become a little hostile for new prospects, so the old learning flow isn’t ideal anymore. So, one of his suggestions is making easier for people to learn while they are developing. Having tools that can highlight relevant information in your code, or showing in real time changes made in your projects so you don’t have to switch from the editor to your browser and then to documentation on the web to find solutions to your problems. The idea is to have all of that in just one environment, so you don’t have to constantly switch between your tools.</p>
