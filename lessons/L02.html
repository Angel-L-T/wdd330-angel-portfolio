        <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
        <p>What I learned from these videos was the Mobile-First design should be the beginning when building web-apps. It is better and easier to escalate from a mobile design to a desktop one. Then, to create appealing web applications we should first understand the mobile users’ needs better than they do. For example, a good UX (user experience) design considers loading times and tries to improve them by techniques like using less images and minifying code. Other ways of improving UX are: 1. Strategic menu design, which considers how users hold their mobile devices and the reach of their thumbs on the screen. 2. Creating mobile friendly forms that are small simple and easy to fill. 3. Adding non-intrusive advertising that is appealing and is smaller than the quantity of content in a page.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming (JS Novice to Ninja)</h3>
        <p>From this chapter I learned that is a way of programming that tries to keep pieces of code (properties and methods) altogether in objects with specific tasks. This chapter mentions three concepts of OOP which are encapsulation (keeping working code altogether and hidden from users), polymorphism (using same methods between objects with different implementations), and inheritance (inheriting functionality from other objects but adding more functionality to children objects). Then the rest of the chapter explains how you can create objects with constructor functions, with classes, with object literals; in a few words the different ways you can follow OOP in JS. Explains how you can create more functional objects from other objects using different types of inheritance. Also shows how you can keep properties from your objects protected against users making undesirable changes to them, and the best way to control those changes using setter and getter functions.</p>
        <p>Long story short, all the chapter covers the different ways that you can create objects, change them, or improve them with more functionality (even the built-in functions in JS), and how to prevent your code to become too complicated. It was such a dense reading that I will save just the names of some topics to remember them in the future.</p>

        <h3>Object Methods, “This”</h3>
        <p>When I was reading about OOP, I noticed “this” in some code examples so I decided to look for an explanation and I found this video on YouTube: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvicrj31JOM">JavaScript this Keyword</a></p>
        <p>I like how he explained “this” in the phrase: “'this' references the object that is executing the current function." And with the readings I further understood “this.” So, following that same definition, if we use “this” when creating a class and then we create an instance of that class creating and object, the parameters that we set in that instance are the ones that this is going to reference because “this” references the object that calls the function.</p>
        <p>There was only one thing I didn’t understand in the readings. There’s and example of a use of “this” that returns and error. In the article “Object Methods, ‘This’” in Tasks / Using “this” in object literal. That example shows that the example given uses this but throws an error. I still don’t get the why, so I will keep studying that example.</p>

        <h3>Ch15 Modern JavaScript, Modular JavaScript (JS Novice to Ninja)</h3>
        <p>This section explains how you can use modules in JS. Modules are files with code that has the same objective. As we learned about classes that encapsulates code with specific tasks, but this time all the related code goes into one file. These files are modules. The way to share functions or code from one module to another file is by exporting the files that will be used, and then in the other file importing only the pieces of the module that we need.</p>
