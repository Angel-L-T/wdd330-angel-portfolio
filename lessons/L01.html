        <h3>Syllabus</h3>
        <p>The course is focused on learning how to use CSS, HTML and JS, to build web applications without the help of frameworks or libraries. We are going to use two books from SitePoint for the course, and the technologies we’ve been using so far (Git, GitHub, VS Code).</p>
        <p>The first 4.5 weeks we will work on a team project following the course. Weeks 5-7 we will work on our own team project. The last 4.5 weeks all class will work on something that it is not pretty clear to me.</p>
        <p>Our final grade will be based of our own raking against the course outcomes at the end of the semester, and a portfolio that we should start creating along the semester.</p>

        <h3>Working with groups</h3>
        <p>The main issue with groups is lack of communication, from which other issues arise. One of these issues is not finding a time to work together. We should prioritize the time to meet with our teams, but we should look a way to work asynchronously as much as we can.</p>
        <p>There are some tools to help us achieve this goal of working asynchronously like Slack (Or MS Teams), GitHub and Trello.</p>

        <h3>Course Set Up</h3>
        <p>I have now everything set up. The only thing I had trouble with was SitePoint. I didn’t check the announcements until Monday and I missed buying the premium access. So, I bought it on Monday night, after work. But I just checked the junk email (Wednesday night) to see if they had sent me the code already, and it turns out students on the Pathway program don’t have to buy it. I just had to redeem the code. XD</p>
        <h3>Git It Together</h3>
        <p>I couldn’t check this course because of my problem with SitePoint, but instead I watched this tutorial in YouTube: Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course</p>
        <p>It helped me refresh everything I had learned about Git and GitHub, and I learned new commands on Git like git diff for checking what things have changed on code. I plan to watch the tutorial in SitePoint before the end of the week.</p>
